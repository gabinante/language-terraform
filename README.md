# Terraform + Jinja language support in Atom

Adds Atom syntax highlighting for Terraform.io configuration files that are being templated using jinja2. This is just a hacked together version of the [terraform package by GiantToast](https://github.com/GiantToast/language-terraform) and the [jinja2 package by danielchatfield](https://github.com/danielchatfield/atom-jinja2)

## Install

```bash
$ apm install https://github.com/gabinante/language-terraform-jinja.git
```
